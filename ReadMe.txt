# Observable trends based on the data:

Based on the provided data, I observed the following trends while analysing the data for PyCitySchools.

Scores by School Spending: As the spending range per student increases, the percentage overall passing rate decreases. Schools with smaller budget have relatively higher average Math and reading scores, and higher overall passing rate.

Scores by School Size: Small to medium school size performed better than large school size. As the school size increases, the percentage overall passing rate decreases or drops. This trend is observed also in the average math and reading score, as well as the percentage passing math and reading.

Scores by School Type: The performance of charter schools within all the criteria are better than public district schools. The percentage passing Math, Passing Reading and overall passing rate are significant higher in Charter schools compared to District schools

In conclusion: Charter schools with small size and small budget per student performed much better than District schools with higher budget per student.
